# Bin-Management-System
Bin Management System Made Using OOP and DSA concepts.
 As much as I remember you would need to run bin-write.cpp file first for it to populate a file of random bin levels across random places in Islamabad city.
 This project has still room to grow to make it according to the current times whichever you are living in.
 This was a group project consisting of myself and other two members
